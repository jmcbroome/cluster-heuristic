# cluster-heuristic
Repository containing code for analyzing global SARS-CoV-2 transmission for publication.

The main directory has two major parts, based on two separate runs of the heuristic. The first was treating the USA as a monolith, and examining international introductions alone. The second is calculating clusters individually for each state of the USA. In both cases, samples from countries outside the USA were labeled by their country.

Dependencies include the following python packages:

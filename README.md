# cluster-heuristic
Repository containing code for analyzing global SARS-CoV-2 transmission for publication.

The main directory has two major parts, based on two separate runs of the heuristic. The first was treating the USA as a monolith, and examining international introductions alone. This output is "global_fullout.tsv". The second is calculating clusters individually for each state of the USA, and is saved as "full_gisaid.txt". In both cases, samples from countries outside the USA were labeled by their country.
